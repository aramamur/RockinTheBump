This is for Android API Level 19 and below.  
It works on the KitKat 4.4 OS and is created for the Samsung Note 4.


Functional Requirements:
1.	Shall track pregnant womenâ€™s weight, and give appropriate weight recommendations as well as calories and suggest snacks.  Also must list foods to avoid.
2.	Shall track appointments and give reminders.
3.	Shall track vitals and ability to store pictures taken from the mobile phone for ultrasound.
4.	Shall give weekly update about pregnancy stage. Shall advice for upcoming appointments and how to prepare.
5.	Shall track contractions and give suggestions on when to call the hospital.  

Nice to have next steps after project submittal for class:

1. Plot of the weight, fetal hb, or bloodpressure. Use graphview library for this.
2. Better UI!- some images.
3. Track calories
4. Discussion board or crowdsourcing feature for advice
5. Cross OS platform and test on other versions of Android- it is built for target sdk 28 so it should work for higher versions but it hasn't been tested.
6. Extensive production testing.
7. Using user data to predict pregnancy complications.
