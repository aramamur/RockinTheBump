   Colums should be: Track weight, BP, Fetal HB, current date, uid
 * Update settings class to add a user's current weight and the date in the database when adding a user.
 * Create a Health class which stores: Track weight, BP, Fetal HB, current date, uid

* Plot of the weight, fetal hb, or bloodpressure.
