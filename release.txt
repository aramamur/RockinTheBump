Created database for health and health class
Updated to use the weight as the starting weight

Autoincrement works
Has ability to take pics but camera functionality and picture storage could use some work
Gallery and camera work.
Implemented database that stores the location of the files that the picture takes- stored to external storage private to the app (not in traditional Image Gallery)
The gallery uses the location of these files names in order to display the gallery
Small minor changes- using Picasso for loading images
Made the gallery seperate from take pictures because of errors with the imageview and app intermittently crashing.

Still needs:

40 tips for each week, includes appointment tips and food tips. 

Nice to have:
