has the appointment viewer implemented
Renamed TrackWeight class to Track Health class
Have the buttons and views in place to implement the database. 
Created database for health and health class
Updated to use the weight as the starting weight
When deleting user deletes appt and health data 
Autoincrement works
Has ability to take pics but camera functionality and picture storage could use some work
Gallery and camera work.
Implemented database that stores the location of the files that the picture takes- stored to external storage private to the app (not in traditional Image Gallery)
The gallery uses the location of these files names in order to display the gallery
Small minor changes- using Picasso for loading images
Made the gallery seperate from take pictures because of errors with the imageview and app intermittently crashing.
When updating a user it updates the shared preferences file.
40 tips for each week, includes appointment tips and food tips. 
Renamed file
Made a SettingsAdmin so I can access the secret settings part where I can see all the user info.  The userid account for id=1 needs to be created in order to do this.
Add check if userid is not available someone can't create a duplicate account.
Added javadoc folder to this code.

Nice to have next steps after project submittal for class:
* Plot of the weight, fetal hb, or bloodpressure.
* Better UI!- some images.
* Extensive production testing.
* Track calories
* Discussion board or crowdsourcing feature for advice
